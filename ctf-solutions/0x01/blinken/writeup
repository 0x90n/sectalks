After running the binary in strace to see if it did anything interesting (it
doesn't), I fired it up in Evan's debugger to see what was happening.

The application displays the initial text then goes into a loop, where it
increments a register by 1 and compares it to unsigned 32-bit INT_MAX:

rbx = 0

A Compares rbx to 0xffffffffffffffff
If not equal, jump to B. If equal, continue

B Add 1 to rbx
Compare rbx to 0xfffffffffffffffe
If not equal, jump to A. If equal, rbx = 0 and jump to A. 

This will never complete. You have two options:
- Make use of this software to heat your house
- Break the program in the loop, 
  Step forward to the cmp at 00400af0
  Use the debugger to set rbx to 0xffffffffffffffff 

If you set rbx to the right value, the program continues and pulls together a
string from locations scattered through memory, presumably to prevent people
working out the flag using strings.
