After recovering the information from the NSA's game server, a clever
hacker went sniffing for more and managed to intercept an email
originating from the NSA.

Unfortunately it was encrypted, but he took full advantage of the recent
heartbleed vulnerability and as luck would have it managed to recover the
key used to encrypt the mail!

It looked like an innocent exchange and the hacker started looking for
help to discover any hidden information. However, he attracted the NSA's
attention in doing so and wasn't clever enough to fully hide his tracks.

With the NSA closing in he went dark, but just before doing so he
uploaded the mail and key. He was certain he had discovered important
information but had no time to reveal the details.


(Note the challenge is intentionally vague about what to do with any
information you uncover. The hope is that common sense will lead to
the "right thing" when the crucial information is uncovered, if you
