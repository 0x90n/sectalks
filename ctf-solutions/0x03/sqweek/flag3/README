As an admin, you can successfully pick up the folder. Doing so causes
the client to create a file in your current directory:

| $ ls -al *ppt
| -rw-r--r--  1 sqweek sqweek   35613 Mar 28 20:08 folder.ppt


Standard unix tools make it clear what's going on:

| $ file folder.ppt
| folder.ppt: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
| $ unzip -l folder.ppt
| Archive:  folder.ppt
|   Length      Date    Time    Name
| ---------  ---------- -----   ----
|        40  2014-02-26 23:04   META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
|     46664  2014-02-26 23:04   g.class
| ---------                     -------
|     46704                     2 files


Ok looks like a jar file. I thought about decompiling it to get an idea
of what it does, but cbf so just ran it (can you tell I'm new to
wargames?):

| $ java -jar folder.ppt
| $


Nothing happened? Oh, it created another file, flag.png. That's what
we're looking for.
