A game-like application has been uncovered on a NSA server which you think is
being used to send secret information. Of course, you (and everyone else) wants
to find out if this is true. The system is located at http://54.84.254.198: see
what you can find.

There are four flags. No bruteforcing of the server is necessary for this
challenge; try to keep bandwidth usage to a minimum.

And while it's not part of the challenge, if you manage to pwn the box we'll
buy you beer (!): write your nick to /home/unpriv/03/gotshell or if you get root
do the same for /home/unpriv/03/gotroot. Breaking the server for everyone else
is minus points :)

We'll be answering questions on #sectalks on freenode, though there may be some
questions we choose not to answer. You probably want to lurk there anyway to
avoid missing out on hints.

Flags to both matthew.stephen.james@gmail.com and blinken@gmail.com as you find
them.
