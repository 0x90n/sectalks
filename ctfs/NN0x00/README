The CTF binary is game. The first task is to win the jackpot. This will give
you a hint on how to escalate your privileges and obtain the flag in
/root/flag. The source code is available in game.c

The binary was compiled with:

$ gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack game.c -o game

== Hints ==
1. It's a bss overflow.

2. To win the jack, get the address of jackpot() function and jump to
it directly by overflowing the bss buffer and setting the
function_ptr.

3. Store your shellcode in an env variable. The stack is not
randomised. Get the address of the env variable with your shellcode
and jump to it by overflowing the buffer in bss!

compiled with gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack game.c -o game
chown root.root game; chmod u+s game
there's the shellcode in /usr/share/shellcode
