So, in solving supercomputer the first stop was of course the source of all information on the internet: KaZaA. After grabbing "supercomputer.crack.100.percent.working.not.malware.arj" we were all set to go. But crap, nope there is something wrong here... This crack has serial protection? What? A shareware crack? .... Alright, so the mission is to figure out a valid serial number for your name, to register the supercomputer crack attached. Thx.
