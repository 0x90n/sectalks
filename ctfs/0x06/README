Applicant,

A useful asset ([redacted]) of ours has gone missing.  He got in contact with us
about some interesting information he stumbled across, but there has been radio
silence since then.  It has been too long; he has missed three scheduled
meetings.  At this point, we suspect he may have had an "unfortunate accident"
but we have a separate team exploring this possibility.

What we need you to do is try to pick up what [redacted] was investigating. When
[redacted] got in touch with us, he included an image of his current
investigation workspace.  We don't know any details beyond what's contained in
this picture.  See what you can find out.

[If and when you find the flag, there will also be information about what to do
 with it.]
